        Senior Data Platform Engineer with 6+ years of experience building scalable systems that process petabytes of data. 
        I specialize in designing robust data architectures, implementing cloud-native solutions, and leading engineering teams 
        to deliver high-impact projects.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-text-secondary">
        Based in London, I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex data challenges 
        and create systems that scale. When I'm not architecting data platforms, you'll find me exploring new technologies, 
        working on projects, or sharing knowledge through writing and speaking.
